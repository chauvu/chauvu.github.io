    "# Web Scraping on PubMed\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we scrape scientific papers on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). PubMed is a free database of over 30 million scientific references and abstracts on biomedical and life sciences topics. PubMed is  managed by the United States National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scraping is performed in March 2020 using BeautifulSoup4. Since structure and underlying html code for websites, especially websites that are popular and regularly used as PubMed, frequently change with upgrades, I cannot guarantee that this code will work without modification in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script scraped the [search page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Study%5BText%20Word%5D) for text word *'study'*. At the time of scraping, this search yields almost 10 million references. Due to limited resources, we only scraped 1300 pages and 26000 references. Each reference contains the title, author list, journal where it is published and date of publication. Since scientific journals make money through access fee of publications, I was not able to download the content of each paper for free; therefore, only the abstract and list of keywords are included in each reference. Each reference is also uniquely identified by its `PMID` or PubMed ID."

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To explore the characteristics of IDH and TERT promoter mutations in gliomas in Chinese patients.METHODS: A total of 124 Chinese patients with gliomas were enrolled to study the frequencies of mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter (TERTp). Among the 124 patients, 59 patients were enrolled to study the classification of gliomas based on mutations in IDH and TERTp.RESULTS: Isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations are positively correlated with a good prognosis but mutations in TERTp cannot predict prognoses independently. The combined analysis of the mutations of IDH and TERTp can predict the prognosis more accurately. Patients with IDH and TERTp glioma mutations have the best prognosis, followed by only IDH mutation patients and only TERTp mutation patients, which have the worst prognosis. IDH and TERTp mutations occur frequently in males, younger patients or lower-grade patients. In contrast, only TERTp mutations occur frequently in females, older patients or higher-grade patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IDH and TERTp glioma mutations have the best prognosis, and only IDH mutation patients and only TERTp mutation patients have the worst prognosis. Moreover, the molecular classification of gliomas by mutations of IDH and TERTp is not suitable for pediatric patients.© 2020 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n"
