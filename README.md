# Data science portfolio by Chau Vu
This portfolio is a combination of notebooks I created for my data science projects.

## Web Scraping

**Scrape college rankings from CollegeFactual.com**

Ranking list of American colleges was scraped from [College Factual](https://www.collegefactual.com/rankings/best-colleges/). Details about each college, such as academics, student diversity and tuition fees, are scraped as well. View and download the scraped college datasets from [here](https://github.com/chauvu/chauvu.github.io/tree/main/Data/college_factual). Script for web scraping is provided [here](https://github.com/chauvu/chauvu.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/scrape_CollegeFactual.ipynb).

## Regression Analysis

**Poverty Prediction with Census Data**

This project utilizes data from the aggregate Census and Behavioral Risk Factor data from different counties in the United States from 2003-2018. A total of 9 datasets were downloaded from federal government websites and combined into a single dataset for analysis. Download datasets from [here](https://github.com/chauvu/chauvu.github.io/tree/main/Data/census). Here is the [data cleaning script](https://github.com/chauvu/chauvu.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/census_data_cleaning.ipynb) and the [regression analysis script](https://github.com/chauvu/chauvu.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/census_regression.ipynb).

## Classification Analysis

**Classification of Heart Disease**

This project utilizes the public UCI Machine Learning Dataset on Heart Disease. Most projects perform heart disease classification only on a single database from Cleveland Clinic; whereas this project combined 4 datasets from the Cleveland Clinic, Long Beach VA Hospital, and two hospitals from Switzerland and Hungary. Datasets can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) or our [Data folder](https://github.com/chauvu/chauvu.github.io/tree/main/Data/heart_disease). Here is the [data cleaning and analysis script](https://github.com/chauvu/chauvu.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/heart_disease_classification.ipynb).
