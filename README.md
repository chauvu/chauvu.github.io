# Data science portfolio by Chau Vu
This portfolio is a combination of notebooks I created for my data science projects.

## Web Scraping

## Regression Analysis

**Poverty Prediction with Census Data**

This project utilizes data from the aggregate Census and Behavioral Risk Factor data from different counties in the United States from 2003-2018. A total of 9 datasets were downloaded from federal government websites and combined into a single dataset for analysis. All datasets can be downloaded from our `Data` folder. The data cleaning and combination can be found here. The regression analysis script can be found here.

## Classification Analysis

**Classification of Heart Disease**

This project utilizes the public UCI Machine Learning Dataset on Heart Disease. Most projects perform heart disease classification only on a single database from Cleveland Clinic; whereas this project combined 4 datasets from the Cleveland Clinic, Long Beach VA Hospital, and two hospitals from Switzerland and Hungary. These 4 datasets can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning website or our `Data` folder. The script for data cleaning and classification analysis can be found here.
